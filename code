<h3>payment</h3>
<p>payment types: Robux 
    The lowest I will work for is 3.5k robux, I repeat, I will NOT work for lower. And YOU, I repeat YOU, will be paying any tax roblox implies. (it's been an issue in the past.) 
    "why not USD?" -- dont have paypal or anything like that setup *at this moment*, I intend to in the future 
    there is no exact listed amount per jobs, it can vary depending on how cooperative you are, how hard I have to work, and how long I have to work</p>
